    "This notebook represents an omniscient policy that knows all of the probability distributions. This algorithm knows, every step of the way, the best decision based on its knowledge of the true distributions. It does not have to learn anything. The oracle has optimal parameters $\\theta$, hence it is expected to maximize reward in fewer rounds. "
