    "Research has shown that students prefer to learn a certain way. Though there is no unanimous choice, there is a fair bit of understanding of what a student wants from the content they are trying to understand. We'll assume, there was a survey conducted among students, which asked to know how should information be taught to help them understand in a streamlined manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visual (V): How much preference is given to visual explanations (video, short-film, movie-clip, vlogs).\n",
    "2. Text (T): How much preference is given to written explanations (books, articles, blogs, research papers)\n",
    "3. Demo-based (D): Preference to live experimentation to help understand the concept.\n",
    "4. Practical (P): Explain or demo the topic, & enable us to perform it.\n",
    "5. Step-by-step (S): A guide to practicing / trying to understand the topic in a systematic way.\n",
    "6. Activity / Task based (AT): Preference to contents that are interactive \\& require students to participate\n",
    "7. Lecture (L) : Perference to being passive \\& listen to an expert explain the topic.\n",
    "8. Audio (A) : How much preference is given to audio explanations (podcasts, music)\n",
    "9. Self-evaluation (SE) : Self evaluate their readiness/motivation/excitement for the course.\n",

Research has shown that most answer fall in between, being completely wrong or right. It a research challenge to measure the rightness of an answer \\& depends of the subject being taught. \n",

    "3. Surface / In-depth (ID): Does it provide a surface level or deep understanding of the topic.\n",
    "4. Brief / Concise (C) : Is it short , to the point OR descriptive , verbose & elaborative. Learners have different levels of maintaining concentration \\& rememberance.\n",
    "5. Thorough (T): How well does the content cover the topic.\n",
    "6. Preference / Well reviewed / Well rated (R) : How well rated is the explanation. Remember to write down in education, that we envision s system where teachers would share available resources from various sources \\& are able to use it to teach their students.\n",
    "7. Theoritical / Abstract (A): How theoritical, abstract is the content\n",
    "8. Practical / Hands on (P) : Is it something that can be tried or experienced\n",
